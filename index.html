          <h1 id="myHeader">Jaden</h1>
            <p>Jaden is my first born grandson. He's my strong kid. Jaden was born with Gastroschisis. 
            This is a birth defect of the abdominal wall. This means that his intestines
            were on the outside of his belly when he was born.
            That tube hanging above him are his intestines.

              <p>So then came Noah. He's our braniac. As you can see, 
            he has the head to go with that brain of his.

              <p>And this is Noah now. As you can see, he still has
           that big head for that big brain.

              <p>Jaden and Noah are cousins, but they can fight like brothers
            sometimes. But they are also great buddies.
